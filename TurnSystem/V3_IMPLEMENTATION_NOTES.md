# V3 Turn System Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the V3 Simplified Simultaneous Turn System for Dokkaebi.

## What Has Been Implemented

### Core System Files
1. **ActionPriorityType.cs** - Enum defining the 4 priority levels for action resolution
2. **PlayerAction.cs** - Data structure representing a single player action
3. **ActionResolutionSystem.cs** - Handles priority-based resolution of simultaneous actions
4. **V3TurnManager.cs** - Main orchestrator for the turn system
5. **V3ActionSelectionUI.cs** - Basic UI for action selection

### Modified Files
1. **AbilityData.cs** - Added `priorityType` field for V3 system
2. **DokkaebiUnit.cs** - Added required methods: `GetSpeed()`, `IsAbilityOnCooldown()`, `IsInOverload()`
3. **All Ability Scripts** - Updated with appropriate priority types

### Priority System
- **Reactive (0)**: Automatic responses to conditions
- **Defensive_Utility (1)**: Buffs, healing, control abilities
- **Movement (2)**: Unit repositioning
- **Offensive (3)**: Damage-dealing abilities

## How It Works

### Turn Flow
1. **Action Selection Phase**: Both players secretly select one action for one unit
2. **Action Revelation**: Actions are revealed simultaneously
3. **Priority Resolution**: Actions resolve in priority order (lower numbers first)
4. **Speed Tiebreaking**: Same priority actions resolve by unit speed
5. **Turn Complete**: Prepare for next turn

### Example Scenarios
- Player A: Move Knight, Player B: Shield Archer → Shield resolves first, then Move
- Player A: Attack with Knight, Player B: Move Archer → Move resolves first (Archer dodges)
- Both players Attack with same speed units → Both attacks resolve simultaneously

## Integration Points

### Required Dependencies
- **GridManager**: For movement validation and execution
- **AbilitySystem**: For ability execution
- **DokkaebiUnit**: For unit state and capabilities

### UI Integration
- **V3ActionSelectionUI**: Basic action selection interface
- Needs grid interaction for target selection
- Timer display for action selection phase

## TODO Items

### High Priority
1. **Speed Stat Implementation**: Currently returns default value of 10
2. **Overload State System**: Currently returns false
3. **Grid Target Selection**: UI needs proper target selection
4. **Ability System Integration**: Verify ExecuteAbility method exists
5. **Win/Lose Conditions**: Implement proper game end detection

### Medium Priority
1. **Action Cooldowns**: Implement unit-level action cooldowns
2. **Reactive Abilities**: System for automatic trigger conditions
3. **Animation Integration**: Visual feedback for action resolution
4. **Network Support**: Multiplayer action synchronization

### Low Priority
1. **AI Player Support**: Computer opponent action selection
2. **Replay System**: Record and playback action sequences
3. **Advanced UI**: Better visual design and UX
4. **Performance Optimization**: Large-scale battle support

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- PlayerAction creation and validation
- Priority sorting in ActionResolutionSystem
- Turn phase transitions in V3TurnManager

### Integration Tests
- Full turn cycle with real units and abilities
- Priority resolution with mixed action types
- UI interaction with turn system

### Manual Testing
- Create test scene with V3TurnManager, ActionResolutionSystem, and UI
- Place test units with different abilities
- Verify action selection and resolution works correctly

## Migration from V2 System

### Deprecated Components
- Multi-phase turn structure
- Complex command sub-phases
- Movement phase separation

### Compatibility
- Existing abilities work with new priority system
- Unit stats and capabilities preserved
- Grid and pathfinding systems unchanged

## Performance Considerations
- Single action per turn reduces complexity
- Priority sorting is O(n log n) where n = number of actions (max 2)
- No significant performance impact expected

## Architecture Notes
- Follows existing project patterns (ScriptableObjects, Events, Interfaces)
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Uses dependency injection where appropriate
- Integrates with existing logging system (SmartLogger)
