  - `OnAbilityTargetingStarted` → UI shows targeting mode
  - `OnCommandResult` → UI shows feedback
- [ ] V3TurnManager events fire correctly:
  - `OnTurnStarted` → UI resets for new turn
  - `OnPhaseChanged` → UI updates phase display

## 🎮 **GAMEPLAY FLOW TEST**

### **Single Turn Test Sequence:**
1. **Turn Start**
   - [ ] Turn counter increments
   - [ ] UI shows "Action Selection" phase
   - [ ] Both turn systems synchronized

2. **Player Action**
   - [ ] Select unit (UI highlights, PlayerActionManager tracks)
   - [ ] Move unit (click ground, action submitted)
   - [ ] Select same/different unit  
   - [ ] Use ability (targeting works, action submitted)

3. **Turn Resolution**
   - [ ] Actions process correctly
   - [ ] Unit positions update
   - [ ] Ability effects apply
   - [ ] UI updates to show results

4. **Next Turn**
   - [ ] Turn counter increments
   - [ ] Action states reset
   - [ ] Ready for next player actions

## 🔧 **DEBUGGING CHECKLIST**

### **If Unit Selection Not Working:**
```csharp
// Check in Console:
[PlayerActionManager] HandleUnitClick: [UnitName] (State: Idle)
[PlayerActionManager] Selected unit: [UnitName]

// Verify:
- PlayerActionManager.Instance is not null
- DokkaebiUnit.IsPlayerControlled = true
- V3TurnManager.CurrentPhase = ActionSelection
```

### **If Movement Not Working:**
```csharp
// Check in Console:  
[PlayerActionManager] HandleGroundClick: (X, Y) (State: Idle)
[PlayerActionManager] Submitting action: Move for unit [UnitName]
[V3TurnManager] Action submitted successfully

// Verify:
- GridManager allows movement to target position
- Unit has movement points/range available
- No obstacles blocking path
```

### **If UI Not Updating:**
```csharp
// Check Event Subscriptions:
- PlayerActionManager events properly subscribed
- V3TurnManager UnityEvents have listeners added
- UI components reference correct managers

// Verify in Inspector:
- UI components have manager references assigned
- Event listeners show in UnityEvents section
```

## 📊 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **🎯 Minimum Viable Integration:**
- ✅ Can select and move units
- ✅ Can use basic abilities  
- ✅ Turns progress automatically
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ UI responds to actions

### **🏆 Full Integration Success:**
- ✅ Smooth multiplayer-ready experience
- ✅ Real-time action feedback
- ✅ Proper state synchronization
- ✅ Clean event handling
- ✅ All UI components functional

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue: "PlayerActionManager.Instance is null"**
```csharp
// Fix: Ensure PlayerActionManager exists in scene and Awake() runs first
// Check: GameObject with PlayerActionManager component is active
```

### **Issue: "Cannot select units at this time"**
```csharp
// Fix: Verify V3TurnManager.CurrentPhase == V3TurnPhase.ActionSelection
// Check: Turn system actually started and isn't stuck
```

### **Issue: "Actions not submitting"**
```csharp
// Fix: Check V3TurnManager reference in PlayerActionManager
// Verify: SubmitPlayerAction() method exists and works
```

## ▶️ **QUICK START TEST**

**5-Minute Integration Test:**
1. Open BattleScene in Unity
2. Press Play
3. Click a unit → should highlight
4. Click ground → unit should queue movement  
5. Wait for turn to resolve → unit should move
6. Check Console → no red errors
